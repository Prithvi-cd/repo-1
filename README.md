## a. Brief Introduction
My name is Prithvi Dewangan and i am a student of IIT Madras . I don't particularly have any hobbies to speak of , i really can't just keep doing one thing which i might be interested in at presnet but i get bored too easily . I could say reading mangas might be my hobby since that's what i do in most of my free time . I am not the type to go and roam here and there aimlessly , i would rather sit in my room and do something just as unproductive but yeah... . And there's one thing , I like playing badminton and that's it .
## b. What I Like Most About Git
what do i like most about git is pretty hard to answer as i don't have much experience with it , everybody praises it to be pretty useful but i don't see any such thing.
## c. Favorite Python Assignment
As for assignments , they are pretty fun to solve , may be in the beginning i feel this way as i enjoy coding and trying new things and getting surprised by how much can i reduce the lenght of a code. DSA in itself is pretty interesting too
